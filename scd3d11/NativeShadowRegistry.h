// Replaces SC4's projected BAT shadows (buildings, flora, BAT props, poles) with
// casters in cGDriver's live shadow map. Opt-in with -NativeShadowMasks:replace,
// which also turns on every live path NativeShadowMasks:all enables.
//
// cSTEOverlayManager::AddShadow already turns each caster mesh into a world-to-UV
// projector for SC4's prerendered texture. This module keeps that projector, the
// texture and the mesh for every shadow record the game creates, takes those
// records out of the list DrawShadows draws, and hands the driver the ones each
// static pass would have drawn. True3D props SC4 would not shadow (no Is Ground
// Model) come through the same call once NativeShadowMasks lets it run, and cast
// with their own UVs. Because SC4 tracks every record's lifetime and dirties its
// rectangle when it changes, none of these casters needs a full redraw to stay
// correct. See docs/true3d-shadows-replace-all.md.
