// Phase 1 instrumentation for SimCity 4's two native shadow paths. Read-only:
// it records what the game already does and changes no game behaviour.
//
// Disabled unless -NativeShadowDiag[:<budget>|:all] is on the command line.
// Independent of NativeShadowExperiment; the two patch disjoint sites and may
// be enabled together.
