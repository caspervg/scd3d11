// Shadows cast by the terrain itself, which SC4 never drew
// (docs/true3d-shadows-terrain.md).
//
// SC4's terrain is a height field, so whether the terrain shadows a point
// depends only on how high the point is: (x, y, z) is in shadow when terrain
// between it and the sun rises above the ray towards the sun. The map keeps,
// for every (x, z), the altitude below which that happens - the shadow
// ceiling - so the composite needs one sample per pixel and treats ground,
// walls and roofs alike.
//
// The map is laid out along the light, a row running downwind, so a single
// sweep per row fills it:
//
//     ceiling[i + 1] = max(ceiling[i], terrain[i]) - spacing * drop
//
// where drop is how far the ray to the sun falls per unit of horizontal
// distance. That is exact for the sampled terrain and costs O(1) per texel.
